    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "To study and compare four major deep learning frameworks—TensorFlow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch. The aim is to identify their distinct features, capabilities, advantages, limitations, and typical use-cases. This comparison will serve as a foundation for understanding which framework is suitable for different kinds of machine learning and deep learning projects. <p>"

    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "Deep learning frameworks provide an ecosystem for designing, training, and deploying neural networks. Each framework has evolved over time with unique design philosophies, computational models, and levels of abstraction.\n",
    "This assignment requires a detailed study of each package from both theoretical and practical perspectives. A small demonstration using a suitable dataset (MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom) should be included to show how a simple neural network is implemented in each framework. <p>"
